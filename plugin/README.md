# Minecraft AI Build Plugin

## Overview
This plugin integrates with a Node.js backend to provide an AI-driven procedural building engine for Minecraft. Players can generate complex structures using natural language prompts through the `/aibuild` command and can undo their actions with the `/aiundo` command.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Structure Generation**: Utilizes Google Gemini to generate Minecraft structures based on user prompts.
- **Deterministic Fallback**: Provides predefined structures for users without an API key.
- **Undo Functionality**: Maintains a per-player undo buffer to revert changes.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have a compatible version of Paper installed on your Minecraft server.
2. Build the plugin using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Place the generated JAR file from the `target` directory into the `plugins` folder of your Paper server.
4. Start the server to load the plugin.

## Commands
- `/aibuild <prompt>`: Generates a structure based on the provided prompt.
- `/aiundo`: Reverts the last structure generated by the player.

## Configuration
The plugin configuration is defined in `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`. Ensure that the commands are correctly registered.

## Backend Integration
The plugin communicates with the Node.js backend to send prompts and receive structure definitions. Ensure the backend is running and accessible from the Minecraft server.
